# Video and Audio Highlights

## Overview
This function can identify, extract, and render highlights from a video or audio file based on search phrases provided by the user. It does this by transcribing the file, using an algorithm combined with a language model to identify the most relevant parts of the content, and then rendering the highlights into a new content cuts.

## Other Settings
In order to control the settings of the highlights, we recommend checking out the [Transcript Analysis](https://www.sievedata.com/functions/sieve/video_transcript_analyzer) function which gives you more control over the transcript analysis process.

*Note: This function requires an OpenAI API key to run. You can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup). You can then enter that API key [here](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard/settings/secrets) under the name `OPENAI_API_KEY`.*
